# CrowdCube - React + Vite Setup

CrowdCube is a modern web application template built with **React** and **Vite**, designed to help you get started with creating dynamic, responsive web apps. This template provides a minimal and optimized setup that includes **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for fast development, integrated **ESLint** for consistent code style, and modern libraries to enhance your app's UI and animation features.

This template is perfect for building fast, scalable web applications with React, leveraging the power of Vite as the bundler and developer server, and features like **Tailwind CSS**, **React Simple Typewriter**, and **React Awesome Reveal** for enhanced styling and animations.
