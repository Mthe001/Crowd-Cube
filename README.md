# CrowdCube - React + Vite Setup

CrowdCube is a modern web application template built with **React** and **Vite**, designed to help you get started with creating dynamic, responsive web apps. This template provides a minimal and optimized setup that includes **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for fast development and integrated **ESLint** for consistent code style.

This template is perfect for building fast, scalable web applications with React, leveraging the power of Vite as the bundler and developer server.
