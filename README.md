# CrowdCube -

CrowdCube is a modern web application template built with **React** and **Vite**, designed to help you get started with creating dynamic, responsive web apps. This template provides a minimal and optimized setup that includes **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for fast development, integrated **ESLint** for consistent code style, and modern libraries to enhance your app's UI and animation features.

This template is perfect for building fast, scalable web applications with React, leveraging the power of Vite as the bundler and developer server, and features like **Tailwind CSS**, **React Simple Typewriter**, and **React Awesome Reveal** for enhanced styling and animations.

## Features

- **Fast Refresh** using React, enabled by either:
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) (Babel-based)
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) (SWC-based, faster alternative)
  
- Integrated **ESLint** for maintaining code quality and consistency, with automatic linting support.

- **Vite** for fast builds and optimized production performance, including support for TypeScript and JSX syntax.

- **React** for building interactive and dynamic UIs with component-based architecture.

- Example **Contact Page** with **sweetalert2** integration for form submission notifications:
  - Display an alert when the user attempts to send a message.
  - Shows a success notification after the message is submitted.

- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design:
  - Easily customizable theme using the `tailwind.config.js` file.

  - Adds entrance animations to elements when they scroll into view (e.g., fade-ins, slides, zoom effects).
  - Configurable animation triggers based on scroll position, with smooth transition effects.

- **React Router** for page navigation and routing between components:
  - Supports multiple pages with dynamic URL paths.
  - Includes configuration for easy navigation between homepage, about page, contact page, and more.

- **Form Validation (optional)** using **React Hook Form**:
  - Easy-to-use form validation setup for dynamic forms.
  - Simplifies managing form data, validation, and submission handling.

- **Modern Web Development Tools**:
  - **ESLint** for code linting and style consistency.
  - **Prettier** for auto-formatting code according to a standardized style.
  - **Husky** for running scripts before committing code (e.g., linting or formatting).
